				The 2010 fundraiser has been successfully concluded after its day of highest donations: <b>$583,890.54</b>!  From a data analytics perspective, there are still a number of things to tie up.  
				One of the first areas on which to renew our focus lies in really digging into data outside from countries outside of the U.S.  The U.S. makes up the lions share of donations worldwide 
				and as a consequence emphasis is put on analyzing the data derived from American donors.  However, future fundraisers will set ever increasing goals (potentially growing exponentially 
				for the next few years) and so the greatest opportunity in meeting these new goals may be in courting donors outside of the U.S.  Therefore accurate and comprehensive analytics will need to 
				be developed for this portion of donations.

				Aside from expansion of the analytics to accurately capture more of our donor base, the data processing itself is in a state of development.  There is work to be done on associating
				contribution tracking with impressions and landing page request data stored in our server logs even though we've come a long way since the beginning of this fundraiser.  
				As for analysis, the questions that are being answered have evolved with the fundraiser and the sophistication of the data processing.  We developed a fairly high turnover system of banner 
				and landing page testing using 
				<a href="http://fundraising.wikimedia.org/stats/fundraiser_analytics.html">tools and plots</a> that allowed us to look into the data and these tools will continue to be developed to provide 
				more comprehensive views of trends and data over the course of the fundraiser.  So more detailed analyses will be possible througout the next couple of months as the reporting and analysis tools 
				are built out.
				
				</p>
				
				<p style="color: black">
				With the immediate needs of an ongoing fundraiser taking priority no longer a constraint a new phase of work is underway, where longer term trends can be investigated that enables us 
				to dig deep into the data and prepare for future fundraisers.
