				<h2 class="title">Big Data</h2><br>

				<p style="color: black">

				This week I attended the Strata "Big Data" conference in Santa Clara, and one of the major themes was the so called "noSQL" database movement.  From my incomplete understanding,
				this name functions as a blanket term for a group of data management systems that tend not to be relational and support some sort of distributed management, necessitated by the increasingly large datasets that are springing up.
				This will become even more important as data becomes more information rich and less structured and demands on fast intelligent algorithms are increasingly large.
				There are a couple of concepts that have helped in my understanding of these distinctions.

				</p>

				<p style="color: black">

				First is denormalization, or non-normalized data, where the relational structure of data is removed, allowing data to be easily stored in the absence of a relational schema.
				This natrally leads to scenarios where columns are dynamically determined and each column of a data record is indexed.  The idea here is that huge amounts of storage are cheap and at our
				disposal.  Sharding is a second core concept which refers to the distributed structure of a data management system and how it alots distibuted processing and storage of the data.
				In my current understanding an implementation of this technique is the much bandied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">Map Reduce</a> algorithm which determines how to break data up among a
				set of distributed nodes.

				</p>

				<p style="color: black">

				Of course many of the talks were far more applied and focused on the consumption of these systems and how large scale users were leveraging them.  Some open-source implementations that
				received a lot of the attention included Cassandra (initially developed at Facebook), and Hadoop with Map Reduce.  It can be tricky classifying these systems together as they each have different
				strengths and depending on the users needs.  However, overall it seems that the idea of a database has become a more abstract and consequently more involved and complex entity.  There is no longer a
				fixed definition of how to manage, store, and process large data stores.

				</p>

				<p style="color: black">

				Aside from this there were some great talks and the presence of a lot of the larger tech companies that are sitting at the forefront of "big data" management.  There wasn't a huge deal of
				theory in the content of the talks and where it did slip in the prespective was typically very high-level and simplified.
				An exception to this trend was <a href="http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~turian/">Joseph Turian's</a> talk on <a href="http://strataconf.com/strata2011/public/schedule/detail/16934">New Developments on Data Techniques</a>
				which feratured a great high-level run through of deep belief networks in addition to content discussing, Semantic Hashing, Graph Paralellism, and Semantic Parsing to paint an elegant
				picture of techniques that could very well become a central feature of the future of search.
